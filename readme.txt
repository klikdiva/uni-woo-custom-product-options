== Frequently Asked Questions ==

** Q: Do I need to back up before update? **
A: Yes, always and ever! Back up your files as well as database. Always test new versions of the plugin on test/stage server first!

** Q: I'm using Uni CPO 3.1.8 or below purchased on codecanyon.net. Do I need to update immediately? **
A: We wouldn't recommend to do this yet. First, this version is so called 'lite' version and will always have less features than future 'pro' version. Also, **version 4 is incompatible with the previous versions of the plugin**. The migration script isn't ready yet.
